A datatype representing fetched data.

If you find yourself continually using `Maybe (Result Error a)` to
represent loaded data, or you have a habit of shuffling errors away to
where they can be quietly ignored, consider using this. It makes it
easier to represent the real state of a remote data fetch and handle
it properly.


For more on the motivation, take a look at the blog post [How Elm Slays A UI Antipattern](http://blog.jenkster.com/2016/06/how-elm-slays-a-ui-antipattern.html).


To use the datatype, let's look at an example that loads `News` from a feed.

First you add to your model, wrapping the data you want in `WebData`:


    type alias Model =
        { news : WebData News }


Then add in a message that will deliver the response:


    type alias Msg
        = NewsResponse (WebData News)


Now we can create an HTTP get:


    getNews : Cmd Msg
    getNews =
        Http.get decodeNews "/news"
            |> RemoteData.asCmd
            |> Cmd.map NewsResponse


We trigger it in our `init` function:


    init : ( Model, Cmd Msg)
    init =
        ( { news = Loading }
        , getNews
        )


We handle it in our `update` function:


    update msg model =
        case msg of
            NewsResponse response ->
                ( { model | news = response }
                , Cmd.none
                )



Most of this you'd already have in your app, and the changes are just
wrapping the datatype in `Webdata`, and updating the `Http.get` call
to add in `RemoteData.asCmd`.

Now we get to where we really want to be, rendering the data and
handling the different states in the UI gracefully:


    view : Model -> Html msg
    view model =
      case model.news of
        NotAsked -> text "Initialising."

        Loading -> text "Loading."

        Failure err -> text ("Error: " ++ toString err)

        Success news -> viewNews news


    viewNews : News -> Html msg
    viewNews news =
        div []
            [h1 [] [text "Here is the news."]
            , ...]

{-| Frequently when you're fetching data from an API, you want to represent four different states:
  * `NotAsked` - We haven't asked for the data yet.
  * `Loading` - We've asked, but haven't got an answer yet.
  * `Failure` - We asked, but something went wrong. Here's the error.
  * `Success` - Everything worked, and here's the data.
-}
type RemoteData e a
    = NotAsked
    | Loading
    | Failure e
    | Success a


{-| While `RemoteData` can model any type of error, the most common
one you'll actually encounter is when you fetch data from a REST
interface, and get back `RemoteData Http.Error a`. Because that case
is so common, `WebData` is provided as a useful alias.

they were one.

If their value is `NotAsked`, the result is `NotAsked`.
If their value is `Loading`, the result is `Loading`.

{-| Apply an Elm update function - `Model -> (Model, Cmd Msg)` - to any `Successful`-ly loaded data.

It's quite common in Elm to want to run a model-update function, over
some remote data, but only once it's actually been loaded.

For example, we might want to handle UI messages changing the users
settings, but that only makes sense once those settings have been
returned from the server.

This function makes it more convenient to reach inside a
`RemoteData.Success` value and apply an update. If the data in not
`Success a`, it is return unchanged with a `Cmd.none`.

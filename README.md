## Development
Being an organization page, the `master` branch is the deploy, not `gh-pages`.
If you want to do development, we have a `dev` branch that you should treat as master.

## Deploy
One liner: `git subtree push --prefix resources/public/ origin gh-pages`

## Elm
This is an Elm application. Compile and use ;)

            <p>Delightful. Simple. Seamless. Software should be a joy to use, easy to learn, and maximize the ease of accomplishing tasks. Humans shouldn’t have to think about how to do something; that’s why we have machines in the first place. Your users value a well-designed experience, and so do we.</p>
